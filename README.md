# Implement C program to change the volume of an audio file

### Complete the implementation of volume.c, such that it changes the volume of a sound file by a given factor.

The program should accept three command-line arguments:
1. The first is input, which represents the name of the original audio file.
2. The second is output, which represents the name of the new audio file that should be generated.
3. The third is factor, which is the amount by which the volume of the original audio file should be scaled.

For example, if factor is 2.0, then the program will double the volume of the audio file in input and save the newly generated audio file in output.
